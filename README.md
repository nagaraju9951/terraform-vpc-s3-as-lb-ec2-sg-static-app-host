# Introduction:
In this blog post, we'll explore how to use Terraform, an infrastructure as code tool, to provision resources on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We'll walk through a sample Terraform configuration that creates a basic AWS environment consisting of VPC, EC2 instances, S3 bucket, Auto Scaling Group, Load Balancer, and more.

# Setting up the VPC:

The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is the foundational networking component in AWS.
Terraform code defines a VPC with a specified CIDR block (IP address range).
It also creates an Internet Gateway and associates it with the VPC to enable internet access.

# Creating Subnets:

Subnets are segmented portions of the VPC.
Terraform defines two subnets in different availability zones for fault tolerance.

# Configuring Security Groups:

Security groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
The Terraform code creates a security group allowing HTTP and SSH traffic.

# Deploying EC2 Instances:

EC2 instances are virtual servers in the AWS cloud.
Terraform provisions an EC2 instance within one of the defined subnets, specifying the instance type, AMI, and key pair.

# Setting up an S3 Bucket:

Amazon S3 is a scalable object storage service.
Terraform creates an S3 bucket and configures it to host a static website.
It uploads an index.html file to the bucket, making it accessible via the web.

# Implementing Auto Scaling:

Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
Terraform sets up an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with minimum and maximum instance counts.
It attaches the ASG to a Target Group for load balancing.

#Configuring a Load Balancer:

The Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
Terraform provisions an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and configures it with listeners and a target group.
It associates the ALB with the ASG for distributing traffic.
